## social media icons &amp; links

The goal is for anyone to use this code to create a custom social media icon bar without the `iframe`s used by social media widgets.

The SVG icon images are produced from Dan Leech's [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) project.

We avoid the HTTP requests involved in loading each icon image.

All the social media links will be added to `index.html`.

### Why use it?

* ["Those tiny Tweet, Like, +1 buttons you see on websites are actually brutally large elements to load for (mobile) devices."](http://zurb.com/article/883/small-painful-buttons-why-social-media-bu)
* ["Services like AddThis and ShareThis will always spy on and tag your audience when you use their widgets"](http://ma.tt/2014/07/canvas-fingerprinting-addthis)

## TODO

* Add all the social media links to `index.html`.
* Make a social media icon bar example for each icon size in `index.html`.
